Distributed systems are notoriously hard to write and understand. Tools that enable visualizing the distributed computation are therefore a valuable tool in this field.  

The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for tools to visualize distributed computations. The proof-of-concept tool shall build animated time-space (or space-time) diagrams for distributed computation traces.
