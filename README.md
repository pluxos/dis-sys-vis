#Distributed Systems' traces Visualization Tool

Distributed systems are notoriously hard to write and understand. Tools that enable visualizing the distributed computation are therefore a valuable tool in this field.

The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for tools to visualize distributed computations. So far our prototype allows visualization in the form of build animated time-space (or space-time) diagrams and hyperbolic trees.
