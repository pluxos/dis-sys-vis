### Welcome to the Distributed Systems Visualization project.
Distributed systems are notoriously hard to write and understand. Tools that enable visualizing the distributed computation are therefore a valuable tool in this field.

The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for tools to visualize distributed computations. So far our prototype allows visualization in the form of build animated time-space (or space-time) diagrams and hyperbolic trees.

## Live Demo
For a live demo, go here http://pluxos.github.io/dis-sys-vis/live/index.html


## Instalation and Compilation
If you would rather run the tool directly from your own box, the following steps should be followed:

1. Download and install node.js following the steps from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Download and install Browserify: `npm install -g browserify`
3. Download DSVis: `git clone git@github.com:pluxos/dis-sys-vis.git` or dowload the zip from http://pluxos.github.io/dis-sys-vis/
4. cd to folder ?
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Build the library without minification: `make clean debug` Resulting file is called `vsdis.js`
7. Build the library with minification: `make clean all` Resulting file is called `vsdis-min.js`
7. Import the resulting file into your project.
